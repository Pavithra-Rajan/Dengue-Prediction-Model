Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. Since, it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. This is a machine learning model that will help us predict the spread of Dengue fever across the world. Since the primary vector of this disease are mosquitoes, the spread should be highly dependent on climate and vegetation factors.
Random Forest Regressor and Gradient boosting have been adopted of which Gradient Boosting has come out to be with the least MAE. The trained model can be deployed across any city around the world and using the most valuable features, we can predict the total cases. This analysis can also help the governments in creating plans to combat this disease.
